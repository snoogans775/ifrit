# Ifrit Wildfire Prediction Model

A naive wildfire assessment algorithm based on MODIS and LANDSAT imagery.

## Platform
Currently, Ifrit is a native app to the Google Earth Engine cloud service.

## Goals
The app currently has a very high signal-noise ratio and is unusable for most prediction applications.
- Herbacity needs to be compared to existing fires -
- Interface needs continuous sliders for temperature thresholds -
- Masking needs to be augmented with a more robust prediction model (ML, Regression...)
